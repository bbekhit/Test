// we use classes to make a reusable code and make multiple instances of it

// the constructor function is the function that's get called when we make a new
// instance of the class

// // when i want to create a new class that extends another class i use super to get access
// to the contructor function and all its properties

// use of the reducer in redux is to maintain the state

// we use thunk for middleware, so it can delay to dispatch an action or dispatch when certain
// condition is met

//preventDefault() stops the default action of an element from happening.
// For example: Prevent a submit button from submitting a form.

// componentWillMount is invoked before rendering

// componentwillReceive props is invoked when a mounted component receives new props

// Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment.

// ES6 classes-arrow function-let&const-promises-

// why we should use axios through 3 stages and how to integrate it with redux

// what is initialState => initialization of state variables

// we use combine reducer for

// major lifecycle methods(built in methods)
// componetDidMount
// componetDidUpdate

// use of dispatch in redux
// dispatch actions to the sore and trigger state changes

var myDate = new Date();
var utcDate = myDate.toUTCString();

// use of setState
// While it is technically possible to alter state by writing to this.state directly,
//  it will not lead to the Component re-rendering with new data,
//   and generally lead to state inconsistency.

// Component state is a way of holding, processing
// and using information that is internal to a given Component and allows you to implement its logic

// method is a function inside an object
