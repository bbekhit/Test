The general principles of the Agile Method

Satisfy the client and continually develop software.
Changing requirements are embraced for the clientâ€™s competitive advantage.
Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be placed on the shortest possible time span.
Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project.
Projects must be based on people who are motivated. Give them the proper environment and the support that they need. They should be trusted to get their jobs done.
Face-to-face communication is the best way to transfer information to and from a team.
Working software is the primary measurement of progress.
Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain an indefinite, constant pace.
Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility.
Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximizing the work that is not done, and it is essential.
Self-organized teams usually create the best designs.
At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they will tune and adjust their behavior accordingly.

Scrum is a framework that is used to implement Agile development.
